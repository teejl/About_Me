# About TeeJ

## Hello world. 
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

My name is TeeJ. Yes it is a nickname. My parents weren't cool enough to give me a name like TeeJ. Sometimes I like to think I'm the only one in the world that goes by a name like TeeJ. If that was the case then my name's uniqueness would guarantee my awesomeness. 

I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in Pure Mathematics. I like to think of myself as a mathematician just as all the old geezers did. However my contribution as a mathematician isn't like theirs. They directly contributed by writing papers, while I am simply a soldier on the front lines. I swing away at problems in front of me with my calculator. I am just an average citizen trying to get by. I guess some can say "average" is very subjective. Nonetheless, I love solving problems in anyway I can. When you break everything down that is who I am a Problem Solver. 

## Patience is a Virtue
"Open up your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you are living?" Bob Marley

Patience is a good thing to have. Too bad I tend to lose my patience all the time. I get in a rush. Some might say I'm like an energizer bunny marching on the front lines. Beat by beat I never quit. If I have to slow down I never stop moving, and instead I'd rather go in circles. It is nice to have faith that no matter where we are as people that we have faith that we will be where we want to be. That and everything is going to be okay. Bob Marley was on to something.  

## Off the Bridge
"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

If you read this take a risk today. Or else.

I'm not going to lie taking a risk is tough. It is like jumping off a bridge. It builds up into that moment until you jump. Thinking too long can force you to back down. Poor execution can make you look like a fool. However the more we fail the more we learn. It is simple physics. 

## Financial Calories
"Don't look forward, don't look backwards."

I was thinking today that it would be a strange society if we had to buy calories. Now this might not make any sense at first, but what I mean is that in order to purchase food you pay in calorie tickets. Then calorie tickets could be purchased by a 3rd source, namely a government. It would help regulate health in a society. For example, if someone wanted to buy a 100 calorie bag of chips they would have to use equivalent of 100 calorie tickets. Also if this fantasy did exist one could be awarded calorie tickets for working out or perhaps some other activities.

## Happiness
"Be so good they can't ignore you." Steve Martin

A lot of the time I forget to be happy. It sounds silly, but it is the truth. Sometimes happiness is tough to find, since its not a tangeable thing. However, sometimes it is just that easy. I find that when I use the 5 senses, I am blessed to have as a human to have, I find myself obtainig happiness easier. I challenge you to try it whenever you are feeling down. Really observe something, feel something, smell something, or listen to nature take its course. In the end our opinion is the only one that matters about ourselves, and we are in control of our own happiness.
